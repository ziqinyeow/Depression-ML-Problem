### The Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database

The database contains 213 images of 7 facial expressions (6 basic facial expressions + 1 neutral) posed by 10 Japanese female models. Each image has been rated on 6 emotion adjectives by 60 Japanese subjects. The database was planned and assembled by Michael Lyons, Miyuki Kamachi, and Jiro Gyoba. We thank Reiko Kubota for her help as a research assistant. The photos were taken at the Psychology Department in Kyushu University.
